At BlackHat DC 2010, I presented a paper called [iPhone Privacy](http://seriot.ch/resources/talks_papers/iPhonePrivacy.pdf).

In this paper, I call the following Apple claim into question:

> Applications on the device are "sandboxed" so they cannot access data stored by other applications.

> In addition, system files, resources, and the kernel are shielded from the user's application space.

> Source: [iPhone in Business - Security Overview](http://www.apple.com/iphone/business/docs/iPhone_Security.pdf)

SpyPhone demoes it is not exactly true. It shows the kind of data a rogue application can collect in a non jailbroken iPhone.

These data do certainly interest marketers, spammers, thieves, competitors and law enforcement officials.
